# Scripts

A collection of several scripts that might prove useful in the future.

### [Port Scanner](https://github.com/rzhade3/Scripts/tree/master/PortScanner)

A port scanner that I wrote in Java for an online course. 

### [News Sentiment](https://github.com/rzhade3/Scripts/tree/master/NewsSentiment)

A sentiment scanner that I am writing for the purposes of stock trading. This scanner will parse through the news feed of 7 popular business news publications, and will spit out a value for the sentiment of the news feed at that time (with a positive number correlating to more positive news, and a negative value correlating to more negative news)
